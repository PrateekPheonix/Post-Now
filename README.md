# Post-Now

# Live Site
https://post-now-htmlcss.netlify.app

My project based on Html5 and CSS3.  
I have made a simple sign up and login page for a social media site "Post Now!".  
This is still not a responsive one. I'll make it responsive very soon.  
Application of CSS flex box and CSS grid.  
I have used fontawesome for icons.  
Google fonts for font families.
